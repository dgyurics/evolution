# Evolution

An experiment using a genetic algorithm.

Genetic algorithm? It is a method for solving constrained and unconstrained optimization problems, which are based on natural selection;
the process that drives biological evolution.

What problem are we solving? In this experiment we are testing the algorithm against the travelling salesman problem.
The problem asks, "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"
It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.
